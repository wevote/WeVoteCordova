# The WeVoteCordova app for iOS and Android

Apache Cordova allows one to take their pre-existing JavaScript WebApp, bundle it with some additional Cordova JavaScript
and native code, and build an app for iOS or Android that can be released as an app in the App Store or Play Store.  
Cordova works perfectly well with React apps.

For a very simple app, you literally just drop it into Cordova and go, for more complex apps (like ours) there are some
changes to be made.  See [Cordova JavaScript Differences](docs/CordovaJavaScriptDifferences.md).

We use a very thin Apache Cordova wrapper to encapsulate the We Vote React WebApp.  The WeVoteCordova side is so thin, that
all it contains is Apache Cordova, some Documentation, and the iOS and Android config (and possibly a small amount of 
native code).  All of the JavaScript and React code, and the libraries that they rely on, remains in the WeVote WebApp.

This Cordova App has two build targets, iOS and Android, and they each
wrap an identical `bundle.js` that is compiled by the We Vote WebApp project.

## You need a Mac to develop for iOS

That's Apple's decision, not ours.  So the iOS portions of these instructions assume you have a Mac, so if you use Linux or Windows, you will
only be able to develop for Android -- we currently don't have install instructions specifically for Linux or Windows, but we hope that
the Android install for Mac will be very similar to what you need.

## You need to have the code for the We Vote WebApp setup on your machine

If you haven't done this yet, don't waste your time, go setup the WebApp with current code,
and get it to start up at least once, and then return here when you are done.

If you can't find a file called `WebApp/build/bundle.js` on your machine, don't proceed
until you can find it.

## Directories

If you followed the instructions for installing the WebApp you put your code at
```
    /Users/<YOUR NAME HERE>/MyProjects/WebApp
    
    or in the specific case of the Example machine:
    
    /Users/stevepodell/WebstormProjects/WebApp
```

## Symlinks

This section is a discussion about Symlinks, the detailed install instructions follow in the next
section.

Plan on cloning the WeVoteCordova app into a directory that parallels the We Vote WeApp directory on your computer.
These might be

    /Users/your-username/MyProjects/WeVoteCordova
    /Users/your-username/MyProjects/WebApp

These two directories are joined together with [symlinks/Symbolic links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link), 
this allows the WebApp setup to "compile" a bundle.js file, and the Cordova setup to access that file (and others) to
have a directory structure setup for running mobile apps with their platform specific IDEs (Xcode for Apple, and Android 
Studio for Android).

## Install our Code and the Cordova Libraries

1. Change to your base "MyProjects" equivalent directory
   ```
   cd /Users/your-username/MyProjects
   ```
   Example: on the example machine the full command line is...
   ```
   cd  /Users/stevepodell/WebstormProjects/WeVoteCordova
   ```

1.  Clone the WeVoteCordova code

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/wevote/WeVoteCordova.git
    ```

1.  Install the Apache Cordova software, this is a command line interface (CLI) that is installed globally on your PC or Mac.

    First do an uninstall, since since any earlier install of the Cordova CLI prior to Version 9, will no longer work.  If you have never installed
    cordova, the uninstall will not do anything (and that is not a problem!).

    ```
    sudo npm uninstall -g cordova
    sudo npm install -g cordova
    ```
    Example: on the example machine that looks like...
    ```
    stevepodell@Steves-MacBook-Pro-32GB-Oct-2109 WeVoteCordova % sudo npm install -g cordova

    9.0.0 (cordova-lib@9.0.1)
    stevepodell@Steves-MacBook-Pro-32GB-Oct-2109 WeVoteCordova % 
    ```    

    Please save in your notes, the path/symlink where cordova is installed. (ex/ `/usr/local/Cellar/node/12.5.0/bin/cordova`)

    Do not proceed until you are at V9, or higher.  
    ```    
    Steves-MacBook-Pro-32GB-Oct-2018:WeVoteCordova stevepodell$ cordova -v
    9.0.0 (cordova-lib@9.0.1)
    Steves-MacBook-Pro-32GB-Oct-2018:WeVoteCordova stevepodell$ 
    ```
    
    (The example machine had a symlink in `/usr/local/bin/` that did not point to where the Cordova 9 was installed earlier in this step, and that 
    symlink had to be manually fixed.)

    a. `cordova` is not added automatically to your path. You might need to run from the symlink you saved above (ex/ `/usr/local/Cellar/node/12.5.0/bin/cordova`)
     
    b. You might be asked: `? May Cordova anonymously report usage statistics to improve the tool over time? (Y/n)` -- that is your choice, either choice is fine.

    ```

1.  Run the (destructive) Cordova CLI commands from within the `WeVoteCordova` directory. 
    ```
    cordova platform rm ios android
    cordova platform add ios android
    ```
    Example:
    ```
    stevepodell@Steves-MacBook-Pro-32GB-Oct-2109 WeVoteCordova % cordova platform rm ios android
    stevepodell@Steves-MacBook-Pro-32GB-Oct-2109 WeVoteCordova % cordova platform add ios android

1.  CD to the www directory and make the first symbolic link for `bundle.js`  This is the `bundle.js` made by your
WebApp build environment, and is located in WebApp/build directory.  Change the path in the following example to match what is 
correct for your environment.

    ```
    cd WeVoteCordova
    cd www
    ln -s /Users/your-username/MyProjects/WebApp/build/bundle.js bundle.js
    ```
    On the example machine that is...
    ```   
    Steves-MacBook-Pro-32GB-Oct-2018:WebstormProjects stevepodell$ cd WeVoteCordova/www
    Steves-MacBook-Pro-32GB-Oct-2018:www stevepodell$ ln -s /Users/stevepodell/WebstormProjects/WebApp/build/bundle.js bundle.js
    Steves-MacBook-Pro-32GB-Oct-2018:www stevepodell$ ls -la

    drwxr-xr-x   4 stevepodell  staff   128 Nov 10 16:51 .
    drwxr-xr-x  16 stevepodell  staff   512 Nov 10 16:45 ..
    lrwxr-xr-x   1 stevepodell  staff    58 Nov 10 16:51 bundle.js -> /Users/stevepodell/WebstormProjects/WebApp/build/bundle.js

    Steves-MacBook-Pro-32GB-Oct-2018:www stevepodell$ 
    ```

1. On github.com, fork WeVoteCordova to your account. Navigate to https://github.com/wevote/WeVoteCordova and then click the "Fork" button in the upper right corner.
    
1. You may need to setup your Github remotes

    ```
    Example:
    Steves-iMac: MyProjects your-username$ cd /Users/your-username/MyProjects/WeVoteCordova
    Steves-iMac: WeVoteCordova your-username$ git remote -v
    origin  https://github.com/SailingSteve/WeVoteCordova.git (fetch)
    origin  https://github.com/SailingSteve/WeVoteCordova.git (push)
    upstream        https://github.com/wevote/WeVoteCordova.git (fetch)
    upstream        https://github.com/wevote/WeVoteCordova.git (push)
    Steves-iMac: WeVoteCordova your-username$ 
    ```
    If you don't have remotes defined... (remember to substitute your github user name for "SailingSteve")
    (The default setup might have the git origin pointing to https://github.com/wevote/WeVoteCordova.git,
    which you will have to remove, since at We Vote we have the origin/upstream reversed from most other 
    projects on github.)
    ```
    git remote rm origin
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/wevote/WeVoteCordova.git
    git remote add origin https://github.com/SailingSteve/WeVoteCordova.git
    git remote -v
    ```

1. Run npm install (it doesn't hurt to do this multiple times!)
    ```
    npm install

   on the example machine...
   
   Steves-MacBook-Pro-32GB-Oct-2018:WeVoteCordova stevepodell$ npm install
   npm WARN org.wevote.cordova@1.0.0 No repository field.

   Steves-MacBook-Pro-32GB-Oct-2018:WeVoteCordova stevepodell$ 
   ```
   At this point, don't worry about any reported vulnerabilites, and don't try to fix 
   them at this moment.

# Platform specific iOS setup (Skip this section if your computer is running Windows or Linux)

Throughout these instructions, remember to substitute your actual user name for "your-username"!

1.  cd to the iOS specific code area, and the www directory in that area

    iOS serves the bundle.js, the index.html, and other files from `WeVoteCordova/platforms/ios/www`
    ```
    cd /Users/your-username/MyProjects/WeVoteCordova/platforms/ios/www
    
    Example:
    Steves-MacBook-Pro-32GB-Oct-2018:WeVoteCordova stevepodell$ cd platforms/ios/www
    Steves-MacBook-Pro-32GB-Oct-2018:www stevepodell$ ls -la

    Steves-MacBook-Pro-32GB-Oct-2018:www stevepodell$ 
    ```

1.  Make the other symlinks that the iOS cordova app will need while running.  (Remember to substitute your actual user name
    in place of 'your-username'!)

    ```
    stevepodell@Steves-MacBook-Pro-32GB-Oct-2109 www % pwd
    /Users/stevepodell/WebstormProjects/WeVoteCordova/platforms/ios/www
    stevepodell@Steves-MacBook-Pro-32GB-Oct-2109 www % rm index.html
    stevepodell@Steves-MacBook-Pro-32GB-Oct-2109 www % ln -s /Users/stevepodell/WebstormProjects/WeVoteCordova/www/index.html index.html

    ```
        
1.  You should test each one of those links, to make sure that they really point to where it needs to. It is much easier 
to test first, rather than making a setup mistake and having to diagnose the problem later on.  Use `stat -L` to confirm 
that the link points to a sizeable file (17856048 bytes in the case of bundle.js), if stat reports a file size of less than 
100 bytes, then the link is probably incorrect.  Use `ls` to make sure that the links for directories, contain a few files.

**You are now done with the iOS specific setup.**


# Platform specific Android setup (Everyone should install the Android software)

1. Remove the Android platform, and then add it back in (Make sure that the command does not have `ios` in it, or
you will undo some of your previous setup work!)
   ```
    Steves-MacBook-Pro-32GB-Oct-2018:WeVoteCordova stevepodell$ cordova platform rm android

   If you get the "**Source and destination must not be the same.**" message, then just 
   add android again.  See the example above.
   
1. Then confirm that `WeVoteCordova/platforms/android/app/src/main/assets/www` exists by changing to that directory
   
   ```
   Steves-MacBook-Pro-32GB-Oct-2018:WeVoteCordova stevepodell$ cd /Users/stevepodell/WebstormProjects/WeVoteCordova/platforms/android/app/src/main/assets/www

1.  The rest of the Android specific setup is a lot like the iOS setup. 

    Android serves the bundle.js, the index.html, and other files from `WeVoteCordova/platforms/android/app/src/main/assets/www`
    Make the other symlinks that the Android cordova app will need while running
    ```

    ```
        
1.  You should test each one of those links, to make sure that they really point to where it needs to. It is much easier 
to test first, rather than making a setup mistake and having to diagnose the problem later on.  Use `stat -L` to confirm 
that the link points to a sizeable file (17856048 bytes in the case of bundle.js), if stat reports a file size of less than 
100 bytes, then the link is probably incorrect.  Use `ls` to make sure that the links for directories, contain a few files.

**You are now done with the Android specific setup.**



## Installing the IDEs:

It is possible to develop for Cordova without IDEs, but you are on your own if you take that path.
An important note about both IDEs, is that they are "needed" for running and debugging iOS and Android apps, but there
is no need to setup GIT in either of them, all the changes that you make within the IDEs affect files that are in the WeVoteCordova 
directory that you just made.  Checkin any changes from the WeVoteCordova directory with the same tools you use to develope
the webapp.  Most Cordova changes in this mature app, are version upgrades of included packages, and version changes for the
apps we deploy in the Apple iOS App Store and the Google Android Play Store.

Install Apple Xcode from the MacOS App Store, you will need a Mac for the iOS part of this project, and a Mac will also be
fine for Android development.

For Android, install the [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)
(a free  IDE, from JetBrains, the makers of PyCharm, WebStorm, IntelliJ, etc.)

## iOS specific IDE and Environment setup (Only follow these instructions if your computer is a Mac)
1.  Install Xcode

    The easiest way to install Xcode is via the
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12" target="_blank">Mac App Store.</a>  The Xcode.app download is approximately 10gb in size.

1.  Install Node and Watchman

    We recommend installing node and watchman via Homebrew.
    ```
    brew install node
    brew install watchman
    ```
    
    On a machine where node may already have been installed, we want to have version 10 or heigher:
    ```
    Steves-MacBook-Pro-32GB-Oct-2018:WeVoteCordova stevepodell$ node -v
    v11.14.0
    Steves-MacBook-Pro-32GB-Oct-2018:WeVoteCordova stevepodell$ 
    Steves-MacBook-Pro-32GB-Oct-2018:WeVoteCordova stevepodell$ brew upgrade node
    Updating Homebrew...
    Steves-MacBook-Pro-32GB-Oct-2018:WeVoteCordova stevepodell$ node -v
    v12.12.0
    Steves-MacBook-Pro-32GB-Oct-2018:WeVoteCordova stevepodell$ 
    ```

1.  Install CocoaPods (an MacOS dependency manager).
    ```
    Steves-iMac:WeVoteCordova your-username$ sudo gem install cocoapods
    ```
    **May 2020:** The default gem for cocoapods failed with a fatal repository not found, or 
    a “fatal: Unable to find remote helper for ‘https’” or a "fatal error: 'cstddef' file not found".  It was possible
    to work around this problem by (loading a specific version)[https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/9270]...
    ```
    cd platforms/ios
    stevepodell@Steves-MacBook-Pro-32GB-Oct-2109 ios % sudo gem install cocoapods -v1.8.4
    ```

1.   Update pod repository
    The following command retrieves the latest pod version metadata from git
    ```
    stevepodell@Steves-MacBook-Pro-32GB-Oct-2109 ios % pod repo update
    ```

    

1.  Opening the project with Xcode -- Open xcworkspace, not xcodeproj directories (or else)

    Be sure to open **`/Users/your-username/MyProjects/WeVoteCordova/platforms/ios/WeVoteCordova.xcworkspace`** each time, if
    you forget to do this portions of the app will not be in your build, since you won't have referenced the cocopods (a dependency manger,
    that pulls in some iOS specific libraries.)

    Be sure **not to open** ~~`/Users/your-username/MyProjects/WeVoteCordova/platforms/ios/WeVoteCordova.xcodeproj`~~ with Xcode,
    and don't pick a choice from the history pane ("Don't click these!") in the Welcome to Xcode dialog.  The history unfortunately will contain
    references to `.xcodeproj` **and** `.xcworkspace` files, but the descriptions are too short to tell the difference.  (Hint:  When that Welcome dialog is displayed, **it is** possible to open the xcworkspace from the File/"Open Recent" menu,
    just be sure to open the xcworkspace.)

![ScreenShot]![ScreenShot](docs/images/WelcomeToXcode.png)

And in the "Welcome to Xcode" dialog, again, don't pick anything from the history list (those are all xcodeproj files), you have to
click "Open another project..." and navigate to the 'WeVoteReactNative.xcworkspace' item (which is actually a directory).


**Clean Build:**

You probably will run into the need to "Clean Build Folder".  To do this in XCode, go to the Product menu, hold down the Option button
(on your Mac keyboard) and select "Clean Build Folder", after it completes (about 10 seconds), press the triangular
Run (Play) button do to a full rebuild


## Opening the project in Xcode

This is very similar to the way we do it with the WeVoteReactNative iOS development.  
  
Download Xcode from the MacOS App Store, and launch it:

Don't use the last opened list, instead click on "Open another project..." (We use an Apple specific packager
called CocoaPods, which forces us to ignore that handy last opened menu.)

After clicking the "Open another project..." button, select the `WeVoteCordova.xcworkspace` file and press Open.

![ScreenShot](docs/images/WeVoteCordova.xcworkspace.png)


Select a simulator type from the menu on top (I use iPhone 8p in this example), then press the triangular green play button,
and the app starts in the simulator.

### Updating the art for the Splashscreen (a rarely required step)

In order to handle the 12" iPad Pro I took the image supplied into Photoshop, resized it to 2732x2732, forced it to have no 
transparent pixels, and renamed it to the required(?) name `Default@2x~universal~anyany.png`.  Then (not being an Xcode expert), 
I dropped the image **within the Xcode program** into `WeVoteCordova/Resources//Images.xcassets/LaunchImage` into each 
location in the universal section.

<img width="1569" alt="screen shot 2018-03-23 at 8 44 35 am" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6923653/37838985-931e356c-2e76-11e8-8473-a1c18b31d87d.png">

This resulted in these files being created:

    ```
    (WebAppEnv)Steves-iMac:ios your-username$ ls -la ./WeVoteCordova/Images.xcassets/LaunchStoryboard.imageset/*
    -rw-r--r--  1 your-username  staff    3765 Mar 22 08:27 ./WeVoteCordova/Images.xcassets/LaunchStoryboard.imageset/Contents.json
    -rw-r--r--  1 your-username  staff  134330 Mar 22 08:27 ./WeVoteCordova/Images.xcassets/LaunchStoryboard.imageset/Default@2x~universal~anyany-1.png
    -rw-r--r--  1 your-username  staff  134330 Mar 22 08:27 ./WeVoteCordova/Images.xcassets/LaunchStoryboard.imageset/Default@2x~universal~anyany-10.png
    -rw-r--r--  1 your-username  staff  134330 Mar 22 08:27 ./WeVoteCordova/Images.xcassets/LaunchStoryboard.imageset/Default@2x~universal~anyany-11.png
    -rw-r--r--@ 1 your-username  staff  134330 Mar 22 08:27 ./WeVoteCordova/Images.xcassets/LaunchStoryboard.imageset/Default@2x~universal~anyany-2.png
    -rw-r--r--  1 your-username  staff  134330 Mar 22 08:27 ./WeVoteCordova/Images.xcassets/LaunchStoryboard.imageset/Default@2x~universal~anyany-3.png
    -rw-r--r--  1 your-username  staff  134330 Mar 22 08:27 ./WeVoteCordova/Images.xcassets/LaunchStoryboard.imageset/Default@2x~universal~anyany-4.png
    -rw-r--r--  1 your-username  staff  134330 Mar 22 08:27 ./WeVoteCordova/Images.xcassets/LaunchStoryboard.imageset/Default@2x~universal~anyany-5.png
    -rw-r--r--  1 your-username  staff  134330 Mar 22 08:27 ./WeVoteCordova/Images.xcassets/LaunchStoryboard.imageset/Default@2x~universal~anyany-6.png
    -rw-r--r--  1 your-username  staff  134330 Mar 22 08:27 ./WeVoteCordova/Images.xcassets/LaunchStoryboard.imageset/Default@2x~universal~anyany-7.png
    -rw-r--r--  1 your-username  staff  134330 Mar 22 08:27 ./WeVoteCordova/Images.xcassets/LaunchStoryboard.imageset/Default@2x~universal~anyany-8.png
    -rw-r--r--  1 your-username  staff  134330 Mar 22 08:27 ./WeVoteCordova/Images.xcassets/LaunchStoryboard.imageset/Default@2x~universal~anyany-9.png
    -rw-r--r--  1 your-username  staff  134330 Mar 22 08:26 ./WeVoteCordova/Images.xcassets/LaunchStoryboard.imageset/Default@2x~universal~anyany.png
    (WebAppEnv)Steves-iMac:ios your-username$
    ```

So to replace the splash screen, I would take `./WeVoteCordova/Images.xcassets/LaunchStoryboard.imageset/Default@2x~universal~anyany.png` and 
replace it with same sized art, and if you wanted to be safe I would use the Xcode IDE to copy them (and automatically rename them)
over the existing files, if you were feeling adventurous you could go directly to the files, and take the new image and 
use it to replace the original and the 12 numbered copies of the old image.

By the way Xcode stores way too much configuration info in a binary file, and messing with them can take days to fix, going directly to the filesystem to make changes is risky.


## Debugging Cordova Differences
Browsers are single threaded, JavaScript on browsers is also single threaded, but JavaScript running in Cordova is 
multi-threaded.  "JavaScript in the WebView does not run on the UI thread, it also has other threads to execute the 
html component and carry out CSS transitions."  This can cause some confusion when debugging Cordova for the first time.

## Debugging Cordova Apps with the Safari debugger


![ScreenShot](docs/images/SafariDevelopMenu.png) 

You don't have to actually use Safari for Mac for anything, but launching its remote debugger.  You can see it opened on its
smallest default page in the picture above, it just has to be running so you can get to that "Develop" menu.  Once you
open the "We Vote Cordova" page that is currently being displayed, in the picture it is the "Welcome to We Vote" page. 
One of the symptoms, of this otherwise good thing (multiple-threads) is tha console.log lines in the resolution of promises
often don't make it to the log.

![ScreenShot](docs/images/SafariSimulatorRunning.png)

It is easy to get the Safari debugger working, and over time Apple is adding more of the features we are used to
from the Chrome Devtools Debugger.


1. Enable debugging in Safari, [see this article](http://geeklearning.io/apache-cordova-and-remote-debugging-on-ios/)
1. Build your 'compiled' javascript app file `bundle.js`, on my Mac it is at `build/bundle.js`.  This file needs to be symlinked
into your www directory (see the section on symlinks above).
    1. On my Mac in WebStorm, I have a Gulp task that has a target "build", when I press the play button for that task, it builds the
bundle.js in 20 seconds (Two seconds to gather all the js scripts together, and 18 seconds to recompile sass).
1. Press the play button in Xcode, which should start the Simulator, load, and then start the WeVote WebApp.
1. In Safari open Develop/Simulator/WeVoteCordova/WeVote and the Safari Web Inspector appears.

## Debugging Cordova Apps with the Chrome dev tools

Chrome devtools is lightyears better than the Safari debugger, but is a bit challenging to get working. See ...

[medium.com article about the remotedebug-ios-webkit-adapter for debugging WebViews](https://medium.com/@auchenberg/hello-remotedebug-ios-webkit-adapter-debug-safari-and-ios-webviews-from-anywhere-2a8553df7465)

[github.com readme about remotedebug-ios-webkit-adapter#getting-started](https://github.com/RemoteDebug/remotedebug-ios-webkit-adapter#getting-started)

Install the remotedebug_ios_webkit_adapter (from a terminal window):


    brew update
    brew install --HEAD libimobiledevice
    brew install --HEAD ios-webkit-debug-proxy
    npm install remotedebug-ios-webkit-adapter -g


Run the remotedebug_ios_webkit_adapter:


    (WebAppEnv)Steves-iMac:WeVoteCordova your-username$ remotedebug_ios_webkit_adapter --port=9000
    remotedebug-ios-webkit-adapter is listening on port 9000
    iosAdapter.getTargets
    iosAdapter.getTargets
    iosAdapter.getTargets
    ...


You may have to restart the remotedebug_ios_webkit_adapter from time to time, to get the
`chrome://inspect/#devices` to see the simulator processes.

After starting the remotedebug_ios_webkit_adapter (hopefully on the first attempt) when you navigate in the Google Chrome
browser to `chrome://inspect` you will see the following screen, with the process to debug on the
list below:

![ScreenShot](docs/images/ChromeInspect.png)
  
Press that little blue 'inspect' to open the debugger, which should look like the following:


![ScreenShot](docs/images/ChromeInspectWDebuggerShowing.png)


If `chrome://inspect` doesn't list your target, then try restarting remotedebug_ios_webkit_adapter and maybe restarting
your Cordova app via Xcode.  This is imperfect, but not too bad once you get the hang of it.

Unfortunately in both the Apple and Chrome debuggers, breakpoints are not maintained between restarts
of the app via Xcode, and also the files where you want to put the breakpoints have to be reopened each time.  (This deficiency
is not the case in React-Native, so hopefully a fix will arrive some day.)

Press ⌘+P to bring up the list of recently opened files -- this can save you a bunch of clicks.

In spite of the previous problem, it is possible to debug a startup behaviour, one that would fly past before you could set the first 
breakpoint -- on the upper left  corner of the chrome debugger, there is a "circular arrow, 
reload button" (see the following image) that will allow you to restart the app within the Chrome Inspector while maintaining
the current breakpoints.

![ScreenShot](docs/images/ChromeCircularReloadButton.png)


## WebApp code changes needed to support Cordova

In Apache Cordova, all the real app code is in that `bundle.js` we make in the WebApp setup, but there are some code
changes in the WebApp that are necessary to support cordova.

[Cordova JavaScript Differences](docs/CordovaJavaScriptDifferences.md).


## Testing from a physical phone with the API server running on your Mac

If you are developing a Cordova specific feature, that requires access to the API server
running on your Mac, while not using the simulator, some extra setup is required to allow
access to your Mac's localhost.

[Testing with a Physical Phone and a localhost WeVote API Server](docs/TestingWithLocalHostFromPhone.md)


## Making a movie recording of the simulator

[See the article](https://sarunw.com/posts/take-screenshot-and-record-video-in-ios-simulator/)

Start recording:

    stevepodell@Steves-MacBook-Pro-32GB-Oct-2109 www % xcrun simctl io booted recordVideo myVideo.mov

End the recording with Ctrl-c in the terminal window.  

Just change myVideo.mov to a unique name of your choosing, and run the command to make a recording.


## Git

The Git branching scheme for WeVoteCordova is the same as for the We Vote WebApp


    git checkout develop
    git pull upstream develop
    git push origin develop


otherwise all else in our github workflow is the same.


## If the cordova plugins are not installed

These should be installed by Git, but if not you might see error "-1100" lines in the log.

In WeVoteCordova/platforms/ios/platform_www/cordova_plugins.js

    module.exports.metadata = 
    // TOP OF METADATA
    {
      "cordova-plugin-device": "2.0.3",
      "cordova-plugin-facebook4": "6.2.0",

    cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-safariviewcontroller
    cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-screensize

Note:  Sometimes the setup needs to be re-run

    cordova platform remove android
    cordova platform add android

If you do this, your changes to ```WeVoteCordova/platforms/android/cordova-plugin-safariviewcontroller/cordova-SafariViewController-java18.gradle```
and to ```WeVoteCordova/platforms/android/app/src/main/java/org/apache/cordova/inappbrowser/InAppBrowser.java``` will have to be redone.

For getting the "Run" configuration to work again, you may have select on the file menu "Sync Project With Gradle Files"


## Android Setup

### Install Android Studio

It's free!  It is based on Intellij, so if you have used PyCharm, WebStorm, RubyMine, or IntelliJ it should be instantly familar.

[https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)
    
TODO: On a clean machine, capture all the steps it takes to get Android Studio
going, and the Java environment setup.  The Android and [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/) documentation are a good
start.

### Running Android Cordova for the first time

1.  Download and install Android Studio

    Click "ok" to downloading and installing any jars or packages that the installer recommends.

1.  On the welcome screen, select "open an existing project"

    The existing project is the WeVoteCordova project that you have already pulled down from git.  Our Android project is 
    contained within the WeVoteCordova project. In the open (file selection) dialog, navigate to your WeVoteCordova working 
    directory, then to platforms, then to android and press Open.  `/Users/your-username/MyProjects/WeVoteCordova/platforms/android`

1.  At that point there will be a series of updates and "syncing" options, where you should follow all the default choices.
    ![ScreenShot](docs/images/GradleSyncWarning.png)

1.  You will probably be prompted to upgrade Gradle, Genymotion, Cordova plugins, etc.

    Update them all before continuing.  Restart as recommended.

    Don't worry about setting a version control root or remote, all changes that you want to get into 
    git are in the WeVoteCordova enclosing project -- That is where you should do your pull requests,
    not within Android Studio.
    
    ![ScreenShot](docs/images/SucessInstallAndroidStudio.png)

1.  Android (Java) projects need a Run configuration to start

    ![ScreenShot](docs/images/AndroidStudioAcceptDefaultSettings.png)

    Accept the default settings and press "OK"
    
    You might see a warning: "**WARNING:** Configuration 'compile' is obsolete and has been replaced with 'implementation' 
    and 'api'.", but it is safe to ignore

1. Press the green "play" button to attempt to start running

    ![ScreenShot](docs/images/AndroidStudioNoDeploymentTarget.png)
    
    If you have an Android phone or tablet, you can plug it in via USB.  Make sure debugging via tethering is 
    enabled (google this. it varies between phone manufacturers).  If it is enabled you will see the name of the 
    connected device (Motorola Moto G, in this example) in the dialog.  Press "OK", and the CordovaApp should start right up on 
    the phone.

<!-- November 12, 2019 The Jack change seems to be no longer needed.  The We Vote project has  pull request against the cordova core plugin cordova-plugin-inappbrowser, 
has been adopted and relased by the Apache Cordova team, so no special intervention is needed in this area anymore.
### Modify Build Configuration

1.  As of March 29, 2018, if you get a project compile error in AndroidStudio ```Could not find method jackOptions() for arguments [cordova_SafariViewController_...```
you might have to remove the jack settings in ```WeVoteCordova/platforms/android/cordova-plugin-safariviewcontroller/cordova-SafariViewController-java18.gradle```
this file is source controlled by We Vote, but updating the plugin could expose this problem again. See "Migrate from Jack" at https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support.html.

    ```
    ext.postBuildExtras = {
        android {
            defaultConfig {
    //            jackOptions {
    //                enabled true
    //                additionalParameters('jack.incremental': 'true')
    //            }
            }
            compileOptions {
                sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
                targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
            }
        }
    }
    ```

2. The We Vote project has made a pull request against the cordova core plugin cordova-plugin-inappbrowser, which we need
to allow our oAuth flow for Twitter and Facebook to work.

### Running Android Cordova for the first time

### Debugging Android Cordova

Just like iOS!  Use the [chrome://inspect/#devices](chrome://inspect/#devices) in Chrome, but no need to start the 
remotedebug_ios_webkit_adapter server, something in Android or Android Studio has done that for us automatically.

### If the Twitter Redirect stops working in iOS

Make sure the custom scheme URL Type is still setup in Xcode

![ScreenShot](docs/images/SettingUpTheIosCustomScheme.png)
__
### iOS has two config.xml files -- make sure you change both

**Don't do this!:** The following commands are needed to upgrade the ios platform
portion of the Cordova install, but otherwise don't do this...

    cordova platform remove ios
    cordova platform add ios

or you will regenerate the iOS specific `config.xml` (platforms/ios/WeVoteCordova/config.xml), and this file will not have config that is
in android specific blocks in the "root" config.xml.  

At run time the only config.xml that matters for iOS is `platforms/ios/WeVoteCordova/config.xml`, so
be sure to manually make the changes in both places (yuck).  If you make the mistake of removing platform for iOS, you will lose
the entire directory for iOS including any configuration you made in XCode -- it might take you a lot of time to recover from
this.

### Moving the spinner upwards on the iOS Splash screen and changing it from grey to white:  Manual step required

In the non-source controlled file `/Users/your-username/MyProjects/WeVoteCordova/platforms/ios/WeVoteCordova/Plugins/cordova-plugin-splashscreen/CDVSplashScreen.m` 
change the line at about line 102:

<!-- 
July 2019:  Don't do this for now, since we now have a white background to the splash screen (again).
two lines.  The first at about line 84:

    UIActivityIndicatorViewStyle topActivityIndicatorStyle = UIActivityIndicatorViewStyleGray;
to

    UIActivityIndicatorViewStyle topActivityIndicatorStyle = UIActivityIndicatorViewStyleWhite;

The second at about line 102:
-->

    _activityView.center = CGPointMake(parentView.bounds.size.width / 2, parentView.bounds.size.height / 1 );
to

    _activityView.center = CGPointMake(parentView.bounds.size.width / 2, parentView.bounds.size.height * 1 / 5 );

### Authentication to Facebook and Twitter in the Simulators

**Android:** Works fine!

**iOS with Facebook:** Facebook auth usually does not work -- depending on complicated circumstances.  It is possible
to test Facebook auth with a local build -- you can use your USB tethered physical device to load your 
latest bundle.js onto the phone, then unplug the phone, and run your test directly through the
internet.

**iOS with Twitter:** It is usable, but not very elegant.  There is a QuickTime movie in this repository that shows the 
login steps (`docs/images/TwitterSignIn4.mov`) -- you can play it on your Mac.  Another note: if you click "Sign in with Twitter" 
and get a blank redirect screen, close it and try again.  It seems to always work on the second try.
