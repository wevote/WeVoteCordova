# The WeVoteCordova app for iOS and Android

Apache Cordova allows one to take their pre-existing JavaScript WebApp, bundle it with some additional Cordova JavaScript
and native code, and build an app for iOS or Android that can be released as an app in the App Store or Play Store.
Cordova works perfectly well with React apps.

For a very simple app, you literally just drop it into Cordova and go, for more complex apps (like ours) there are some
changes to be made.  See [Cordova JavaScript Differences](docs/CordovaJavaScriptDifferences.md).

We use a very thin Apache Cordova wrapper to encapsulate the We Vote React WebApp.  The WeVoteCordova side is so thin, that
all it contains is Apache Cordova, some Cordova optional libraries, some Documentation, and the iOS and Android config (and possibly a small amount of
native code).  All the WebApp's JavaScript and React code, and the libraries that they rely on, remains within the WeVote WebApp, which is wrapped with Cordova for iOS and Android.

This Cordova App has two build targets, iOS and Android, and they each
wrap an identical `bundle.js` that is compiled by the We Vote WebApp project.

## You need a Mac to develop for iOS

That's Apple's decision, not ours.  So the iOS portions of these instructions assume you have a Mac, so if you use Linux or Windows, you will
only be able to develop for Android -- we currently don't have install instructions specifically for Linux or Windows, but we hope that
the Android install for Mac will be very similar to what you need.

## You need to have the code for the We Vote WebApp setup on your machine

This section refers to the WebApp, not to WeVoteCordova.  These are prerequisite instructions for the WebApp.

To build the bundle.js and associated files in the WebApp that are needed for Cordova, delete the WebApp/build directory, and execute the following
one command:

    npm run buildCordova
    

If you haven't done this yet, don't waste your time, go set up the WebApp with current code,
and get it to start up at least once, then build it for Cordova with `buildCordova` and then return here when you are done.

If you can't find a file called `WebApp/build/bundle.js` on your machine, don't proceed
until you can find it.

## Directories

As Cordova evolves these instructions have had to change fairly often, so these instructions use the actual directories on one specific computer. You will have
to change all file paths in these instructions to match the paths in your setup.  

These are the example paths to the
WebApp and to the WeVoteCordova, and to the WeVoteCordovaSaveoff (which we will use briefly to merge Cordova supplied code, with our Code from GIT).
```
    /Users/stevepodell/WebstormProjects/WebApp
    /Users/stevepodell/WebstormProjects/WeVoteCordova
    /Users/stevepodell/WebstormProjects/WeVoteCordovaSaveoff
```

## Install our Code and the Cordova Libraries

1. Change to your base "MyProjects" directory which on the example computer is at `/Users/stevepodell/WebstormProject`

   ```
   cd  /Users/stevepodell/WebstormProjects
   ```

2. Remove any earlier attempts at installation

   ```
   rm -rf WeVoteCordova
   rm -rf WeVoteCordovaSaveoff
   ```

3. Clone the WeVoteCordova code
    
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/wevote/WeVoteCordova.git
    ```
    
4. Rename the directory you just created which contains the latest WeVoteCordova software
    ```
    stevepodell@Steves-MacBook-Pro-32GB-Oct-2109 WebstormProjects % mv WeVoteCordova WeVoteCordovaSaveoff
    stevepodell@Steves-MacBook-Pro-32GB-Oct-2109 WebstormProjects %
    ```

5. Install the Apache Cordova software.  This is the Cordova command line interface (CLI) that is installed globally on your PC or Mac.

    First do an uninstall, since any earlier install of the Cordova CLI prior to Version 9, will no longer work.  If you have never installed
    cordova, the uninstall will not do anything (and that is not a problem!).

    ```
    sudo npm uninstall -g cordova
    sudo npm install -g cordova
    ```
    On the example machine that looks like...
    ```
    stevepodell@Steves-MacBook-Pro WeVoteCordova % sudo npm install -g cordova
    Password:
    npm WARN deprecated request@2.88.2: request has been deprecated, see https://github.com/request/request/issues/3142
    /usr/local/bin/cordova -> /usr/local/lib/node_modules/cordova/bin/cordova
    + cordova@10.0.0
    added 432 packages from 355 contributors in 14.165s

    stevepodell@Steves-MacBook-Pro WeVoteCordova %
    ```

    Most version warnings that installing Cordova might have generated, are unlikely to make any difference.

    Do not proceed until you are at Cordova V9, or higher.
    ```
    stevepodell@Steves-MBP-M1-Dec2021 WeVoteCordova % cordova -v
    12.0.0 (cordova-lib@12.0.1)
    stevepodell@Steves-MBP-M1-Dec2021 WeVoteCordova %
    ```

6. Use `cordova create` to install a new "empty" instance of the WeVoteCordova (with some minimal scaffolding that our copyFromSaveoff script will remove in an upcoming step)

    This will create a "Hello World" Cordova app, named WeVoteCordova.
    ```
    stevepodell@Steves-MacBook-Pro-32GB-Oct-2109 WebstormProjects % cordova create  WeVoteCordova us.wevote.wevotecordova WeVoteCordova
    Creating a new cordova project.
    stevepodell@Steves-MacBook-Pro-32GB-Oct-2109 WebstormProjects %
   ```

7. cd the  `WeVoteCordovaSaveoff` directory and run `npm install`
    ```
    stevepodell@Steves-MacBook-Pro-32GB-Oct-2109 WebstormProjects % cd WeVoteCordovaSaveoff
    stevepodell@Steves-MacBook-Pro-32GB-Oct-2109 WeVoteCordovaSaveff % npm install
    npm WARN us.wevote.wevotecordova@1.0.1 No repository field.

3. Add the Cordova iOS and Android platforms directories
     Note: November 18, 2021:  Don't use latest for android for now, so we use version 9 instead of version 10
     Note: August 2023, need to use ios6.3 or higher to have the app be inspectable with Safari

7. Run a script to set up the symlinks for iOS and Android and make changes to some build files
    
    In addition to creating the symlinks, this script also makes changes to three
    Android Gradle (Java/Groovy build scripts) for Firebase Messaging.    
    ```
    node buildSymLinks /Users/stevepodell/WebstormProjects/WebApp/build
    ```
    These symlinks allow us to access the compiled WebApp and have all the necessary components available for the
    Cordova builds that need to include our WebApp software.
    ```

   If you have installation troubles, you can run `buildSymLinks` as often as you need to,
   since the script cleans out conflicting links that might already in place, before adding in the new links.

10. Run the WeVoteCordova app from XCode.

     In Xcode, Click File/Open and select `/Users/stevepodell/WebstormProjects/WeVoteCordova/platforms/ios/` to open the project in xCode.
          
11. The final step is to start the simulator

     Select a simulator that you would like to see the code executing on.  In the example below, we have selected the iPhone 11 Pro Max.  Then press the Play (Triangular) button, and
     a minute or two later you should get the WeVoteCordova app running in a simulator. 
     ![ScreenShot](docs/images/XCodeOpenedAndReady.png)
     Note: This screenshot shows the logging with the developer option `LOG_RENDER_EVENTS: true,` set in the webapp.
    
     **At this point you have a fully working Cordova iOS build.**

12. **ONLY IF NEEDED:** (We hope this step is not necessary.)   If the Cordova iOS app loads the html page (White "Loading We Vote" on blue), 
but crashes in a JQuery regex, and logs `SyntaxError: Invalid regular expression: range out of order in character class`,
 and never advances to the first React page in the WebApp:

     In the WebApp, delete
     ```
     /build
     /node_modules
     /package-lock.json
     ```
    Then (Still in the WebApp!)

     ```
     npm install
     npm rebuild node-gyp
     npm rebuild node-sass
     npm install
     npm run prod-singleBundle
     npm run start-https-singleBundle
     ```

     At this point you "should" have a fully configured WeVoteCordova app running in your simulator.  
    
     The next step is to connect your new WeVoteCordova directory to Git.

## While repeatedly compiling with buildCordova during development
This comand only relinks the newly compiled bundle.js and bundle.js.map, and completes quickly

     node buildSymLinks /Users/stevepodell/WebstormProjects/WebApp/build bundleOnly


## Git setup
1. On GitHub.com, fork WeVoteCordova to your account. 
    
    Navigate to https://github.com/wevote/WeVoteCordova and then click the "Fork" button in the upper right corner.

    This will create a new directory on GitHub like ... `https://github.com/SailingSteve/WeVoteCordova.git`
    
2. Execute the following commands from your WeVoteCordova directory on your Mac/PC

    **Remember to substitute the name of your forked remote for "SailingSteve" in the following commands!**
    ```
    git init
    git checkout -b develop
    git add --all
    git commit --allow-empty -m "initial commit"
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/wevote/WeVoteCordova.git
    git remote add origin https://github.com/SailingSteve/WeVoteCordova.git
    git remote -v
    git fetch --all
    git reset --hard upstream/develop
    git pull upstream develop
    git push origin develop --force
    ```
    What it looks like in the terminal:

**That's it!  Cordova iOS Installed from scratch in about an hour.**

At this point you can use Git to create branches, use Stash, and use git pull and push to get ready to make pull requests.

**You should only have to follow these install from scratch instructions once (unless you delete your WeVoteCordova directory.)**


# Platform specific Android setup (Everyone should install the Android software)

1. Confim that buildSymLinks setup we ran initially for the iOS www directory, has set up the Android platform directory properly
   ```
   stevepodell@Steves-MacBook-Pro-32GB-Oct-2109 WeVoteCordova % ls -la platforms/android/app/src/main/assets/www

   ```
   If you don't see the symlinks, you can run buildSymLinks again.

**You are now done with the Android specific setup.**



## Installing the IDEs:

It is possible to develop for Cordova without IDEs, but you are on your own if you take that path.
An important note about both IDEs, is that they are "needed" for running and debugging iOS and Android apps, but there
is no need to set up GIT in either of them, all the changes that you make within the IDEs affect files that are in the WeVoteCordova
directory that you just made.  Checkin any changes from the WeVoteCordova directory with the same tools you use to develope
the webapp.  Most Cordova changes in this mature app, are version upgrades of included packages, and version changes for the
apps we deploy in the Apple iOS App Store and the Google Android Play Store.

Install Apple Xcode from the macOS App Store, you will need a Mac for the iOS part of this project, and a Mac will also be
fine for Android development.

For Android, install the [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)
(a free  IDE, from JetBrains, the makers of PyCharm, WebStorm, IntelliJ, etc.)

## iOS specific IDE and Environment setup (Only follow these instructions if your computer is a Mac)
1. Install Xcode
    
    The easiest way to install Xcode is via the
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12" target="_blank">Mac App Store.</a>  The Xcode.app download is approximately 10gb in size.
    
2. Opening the project with Xcode -- Open xcworkspace, not xcodeproj directories (or else)

    Be sure to open **`/Users/your-username/MyProjects/WeVoteCordova/platforms/ios/WeVoteCordova.xcworkspace`** each time, if
    you forget to do this portions of the app will not be in your build, since you won't have referenced the cocopods (a dependency manger,
    that pulls in some iOS specific libraries.)

    Be sure **not to open** ~~`/Users/your-username/MyProjects/WeVoteCordova/platforms/ios/WeVoteCordova.xcodeproj`~~ with Xcode,
    and don't pick a choice from the history pane ("Don't click these!") in the Welcome to Xcode dialog.  The history unfortunately will contain
    references to `.xcodeproj` **and** `.xcworkspace` files, but the descriptions are too short to tell the difference.  (Hint:  When that Welcome dialog is displayed, **it is** possible to open the xcworkspace from the File/"Open Recent" menu,
    just be sure to open the xcworkspace.)

    ![ScreenShot]![ScreenShot](docs/images/WelcomeToXcode.png)

    And in the "Welcome to Xcode" dialog, again, don't pick anything from the history list (those are all xcodeproj files), you have to
    click "Open another project..." and navigate to the 'WeVoteReactNative.xcworkspace' item (which is actually a directory).


**Clean Build:**

You probably will run into the need to "Clean Build Folder".  To do this in XCode, go to the Product menu, hold down the Option button
(on your Mac keyboard) and select "Clean Build Folder", after it completes (about 10 seconds), press the triangular
Run (Play) button do to a full rebuild

## Debugging Cordova Differences
Browsers are single threaded, JavaScript on browsers is also single threaded, but JavaScript running in Cordova is
multithreaded.  "JavaScript in the WebView does not run on the UI thread, it also has other threads to execute the
html component and carry out CSS transitions."  This can cause some confusion when debugging Cordova for the first time.

## Debugging Cordova Apps with the Safari debugger

![ScreenShot](docs/images/SafariDevelopMenu.png)

You don't have to actually use Safari for Mac for anything, but launching its remote debugger.  You can see it opened on its
smallest default page in the picture above, it just has to be running, so you can get to that "Develop" menu.  Once you
open the "We Vote Cordova" page that is currently being displayed, in the picture it is the "Welcome to We Vote" page.
One of the symptoms, of this otherwise good thing (multiple-threads) is tha console.log lines in the resolution of promises
often don't make it to the log.

![ScreenShot](docs/images/SafariSimulatorRunning.png)

It is easy to get the Safari debugger working, and over time Apple has added almost all the features we are used to
from the Chrome Devtools Debugger.

1. Enable debugging in Safari, [see this article](http://geeklearning.io/apache-cordova-and-remote-debugging-on-ios/)
2. Build your 'compiled' javascript app file `bundle.js`, on my Mac it is at `build/bundle.js`.  This file needs to be symlinked
into your www directory (see the section on symlinks above).
    1. On my Mac in WebStorm, I have a Gulp task that has a target "build", when I press the play button for that task, it builds the
bundle.js in 20 seconds (Two seconds to gather all the js scripts together, and 18 seconds to recompile sass).
3. Press the play button in Xcode, which should start the Simulator, load, and then start the WeVote WebApp.
4. In Safari open Develop/Simulator/WeVoteCordova/WeVote and the Safari Web Inspector appears.


## WebApp code changes needed to support Cordova

In Apache Cordova, all the real app code is in that `bundle.js` we make in the WebApp setup, but there are some code
changes in the WebApp that are necessary to support cordova.

[Cordova JavaScript Differences](docs/CordovaJavaScriptDifferences.md).


## Testing from a physical phone with the API server running on your Mac

If you are developing a Cordova specific feature, that requires access to the API server
running on your Mac, while not using the simulator, some extra setup is required to allow
access to your Mac's localhost.

[Testing with a Physical Phone and a localhost WeVote API Server](docs/TestingWithLocalHostFromPhone.md)


## Making a movie recording of the simulator

[See the article](https://sarunw.com/posts/take-screenshot-and-record-video-in-ios-simulator/)

Start recording:

    stevepodell@Steves-MacBook-Pro www % xcrun simctl io booted recordVideo myVideo.mov

End the recording with Ctrl-c in the terminal window.

Just change myVideo.mov to a unique name of your choosing, and run the command to make a recording.


## Android Setup

### Install Android Studio

It's free!  It is based on Intellij, so if you have used PyCharm, WebStorm, RubyMine, or IntelliJ it should be instantly familar.

[https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)

August 2023:  Needed to update to the latest IDE "Giraffe"
then `brew upgrade gradle` from 4.2 to 8.2.1
then in Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Gradle 
in the Use Gradle From (Specified Location) I had to use /opt/homebrew/Cellar/gradle/8.2.1/libexec
The key was /opt/homebrew/Cellar/gradle/8.2.1/libexec NOT /opt/homebrew/Cellar/gradle/8.2.1/bin


### Running Android Cordova for the first time

1. In Android Studio run File/'Sync Project With Gradle Files'
2. I needed to upgrade to the latest Java JDK which I got from Amazon, since Oracle wanted too much info, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-17-ug/downloads-list.html
3. Then in Android Studio at Preferences | Build, Execution, Deployment | Build Tools | Gradle
   Change the Gradle JDK to version 17 and Apply
4. On November 16, 2021, I had to set the gradle directory to a place in the library path
   
   ![ScreenShot](docs/images/GradleSettingsNov2021.png)
   
5. Confirm the relevant paths
    ```
    stevepodell@Steves-MacBook-Pro-32GB-Oct-2109 WeVoteCordova % vi ~/.bash_profile
    ```
    ```
    export ANDROID_HOME=/Users/stevepodell/Library/Android/sdk
    export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=/Users/stevepodell/Library/Android/sdk
    export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
    export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/build-tools/33.0.0
    export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
    export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/platform-tools/
    export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/
    export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/emulator/
    export PATH="/usr/local/opt/node@6/bin:$PATH"
    export GRADLE_USER_HOME=/opt/homebrew/bin/gradle
    export GRADLE_HOME=/opt/homebrew/bin/gradle
    ```
6. If you made any changes, source the edited bash_profile (Can't hurt in any case)
   stevepodell@Steves-MacBook-Pro-32GB-Oct-2109 WeVoteCordova % source ~/.bash_profile
7. Some changes (JAVA_HOME) might be in the z shell config
   ```
   stevepodell@StevesM1Dec2021 android % vim ~/.zshrc
   ```
   ```
   export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/amazon-corretto-17.jdk/Contents/Home
   ```
   ```
   stevepodell@StevesM1Dec2021 android % source ~/.zshrc
   ```
8. You may need to use the SDK installer in AndroidStudio to download/update to the latest SDK (Can take 10 minutes)

9. Download and install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

    Click "ok" to downloading and installing any jars or packages that the installer recommends.

10. On the welcome screen, select "open an existing project"

     The existing project is the WeVoteCordova project that you have already pulled down from git.  Our Android project is
     contained within the WeVoteCordova project. In the open (file selection) dialog, navigate to your WeVoteCordova working
     directory, then to platforms, then to android and press Open.  `/Users/your-username/MyProjects/WeVoteCordova/platforms/android`

11. At that point there will be a series of updates and "syncing" options, where you should follow all the default choices.

12. You will probably be prompted to upgrade Gradle, Genymotion, Cordova plugins, etc.

     Update them all before continuing.  Restart as recommended.

     Don't worry about setting a version control root or remote, all changes that you want to get into
     git are in the WeVoteCordova enclosing project -- That is where you should do your pull requests,
     not within Android Studio.

     ![ScreenShot](docs/images/SucessInstallAndroidStudio.png)

13. Android (Java) projects need a Run configuration to start

     ![ScreenShot](docs/images/AndroidStudioAcceptDefaultSettings.png)

     Accept the default settings and press "OK"

     You might see a warning: "**WARNING:** Configuration 'compile' is obsolete and has been replaced with 'implementation'
     and 'api'.", but it is safe to ignore
    
14. If you get an error relating to accepting the Android SDK license

     Run the `sdkmanager` and accept all the licenses (feel free to read them first)
     ```
     stevepodell@Steves-MacBook-Pro-32GB-Oct-2109 android % pwd
     /Users/stevepodell/WebstormProjects/WeVoteCordova/platforms/android
     stevepodell@Steves-MacBook-Pro-32GB-Oct-2109 android % cd /Users/stevepodell/Library/Android/sdk/tools/bin           
     stevepodell@Steves-MacBook-Pro-32GB-Oct-2109 bin % ./sdkmanager --licenses
     Warning: File /Users/stevepodell/.android/repositories.cfg could not be loaded.

     All SDK package licenses accepted
    
     stevepodell@Steves-MacBook-Pro-32GB-Oct-2109 bin % 
     ```
     Then run File/Sync Project with Gradle Files and you "should" see the following success message in the Sync status pane in the lower right corner of the IDE.
     ```
     KotlinDslScriptsParameter(correlationId=102692066094524, scriptFiles=[]) => StandardKotlinDslScriptsModel(scripts=[], commonModel=CommonKotlinDslScriptModel(classPath=[], sourcePath=[], implicitImports=[]), dehydratedScriptModels={}) - took 0.0 secs

     ```
    
     <!--If you have trouble look at the [Cordova Android Platform Guide](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/android/)-->

15. If you get a red symbol on your run icon, and a "No default run configuration" error or warning
    
     try re-installing npm globally
    
     `stevepodell@Steves-MacBook-Pro-32GB-Oct-2109 WeVoteCordova % sudo npm install -g npm `

16. You will then need to download some simulator Virtual Devices to test with.  Go to Tools/AVD Manager
     ![ScreenShot](docs/images/AndroidVirtualDeviceManager.png)
    
     It is possible that the list will be empty, and you have to use to "+ Create Virtual device..." button to add them from
     scratch, start with at least one.
     
     If your list contains only entries that require downloading, download those that you can, some will have API versions 
     that need to be increased to the minimum that is configured.  These simulators are huge (1GB)
     and contain most of the commercial boot image for the phone that you will be simulating.  
     you probably will need to come back here later to add more, but at least get one
     downloaded, so you can do a test run in the Simulator.
    
17. Invalidate Caches and restart

    Go to File/"Invalidate Caches / Restart" and choose the option to restart. 
  
18. The gradle run that is automatically launched failed for me, so I had to upgrade the [Android Gradle plugin](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/gradle-plugin.html#revisions)

    [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) is a build tool for Java, that serves the same purpose as Ant, or Make, or Webpack.
   
    Since the Gradle version that came with Android Studio was `6.1.1`, edited android/build.gradle to load version 4.00 instead of the version `3.0.0` that came
    preinstalled.

     ![ScreenShot](docs/images/UpgradeAndroidPlugin.png)
    
     After making that edit, simply click File/"Sync Project with Gradle Files" which forces a reload of the Android Gradle plugin, and 
     rebuilds the app.     

19. Press the green "play" button to attempt to start running

     ![ScreenShot](docs/images/AndroidStudioNoDeploymentTarget.png)

     If you have an Android phone or tablet, you can plug it in via USB.  Make sure debugging via tethering is
     enabled (google this. it varies between phone manufacturers).  If it is enabled you will see the name of the
     connected device (Motorola Moto G, in this example) in the dialog.  Press "OK", and the CordovaApp should start right up on
     the phone.

That it! you should have a basic Android Cordova app running in the simulator!

### Debugging Android Cordova

Just like iOS!  Use the [chrome://inspect/#devices](chrome://inspect/#devices) in Chrome, but no need to start the
remotedebug_ios_webkit_adapter server, something in Android or Android Studio has done that for us automatically.

### If the Twitter Redirect stops working in iOS

Make sure the custom scheme URL Type is still setup in Xcode

![ScreenShot](docs/images/SettingUpTheIosCustomScheme.png)

### Moving the spinner upwards on the iOS Splash screen and changing it from grey to white:  Manual step required

In the non-source controlled file `/Users/your-username/MyProjects/WeVoteCordova/platforms/ios/WeVoteCordova/Plugins/cordova-plugin-splashscreen/CDVSplashScreen.m`
change the line at about line 102:

<!--
July 2019:  Don't do this for now, since we now have a white background to the splash screen (again).
two lines.  The first at about line 84:

    UIActivityIndicatorViewStyle topActivityIndicatorStyle = UIActivityIndicatorViewStyleGray;
to

    UIActivityIndicatorViewStyle topActivityIndicatorStyle = UIActivityIndicatorViewStyleWhite;

The second at about line 102:
-->

    _activityView.center = CGPointMake(parentView.bounds.size.width / 2, parentView.bounds.size.height / 1 );
to

    _activityView.center = CGPointMake(parentView.bounds.size.width / 2, parentView.bounds.size.height * 1 / 5 );

## WeVoteCordova/config.xml and WeVoteCordova/package.json background

The Cordova project used to have all configuration for platforms, plugins installed, and plugin variables stored in their proprietary config.xml.  The `WeVoteCordova/config.xml` file is
parsed at build time and rewritten to WeVoteCordova/platforms/ios/WeVoteCordova/config.xml and is used somewhere in Android.

In 2019, it appears that Cordova started using WeVoteCordova/package.json as the
authoritative source of versions of the platform components and plugins
that are used to build the app.  For pulling in libraries (plugins, platforms and Cordova core components)Cordova first looks in packages.json, then in config.xml, and
finally it will load plugins that are not configured, but are present in the
plugins directories:  `WeVoteCordova/platforms/ios/WeVoteCordova/Plugins `and `WeVoteCordova/platforms/android/app/src/main/assets/www/plugins` and 
`WeVoteCordova/Plugins`
 
 The safest way to remove a plugin is, for example `cordova plugin remove cordova-plugin-foo` which adjusts all the
 configuration files, and physically removes the plugin code.   `cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-foo --save` will add it back in,
 and might add the configuration for the plugin version in `WeVoteCordova/config.xml`.  If it doesn't you
 can add it into the `WeVoteCordova/config.xml` manually, or just not worry about it and have
 the code version picked up from `package.json`

Running ...  (Note: August 2023: Need to use a minimum of ios 6.3 see https://github.com/apache/cordova-ios/issues/1301)

    cordova platform remove ios android
    cordova platform add ios@6.3  android
  
will remove everything from the platforms directory, and rebuild all the config files in the platforms directory, but will
also remove all the manual configuration and symlinks that you add.  This is a powerful last resort if all else is going wrong.

## Apple Silicon, Nov 2020 (Updated April 2022)
The WeVote web app that has been developed as described below, can be tested on your Mac.
But do not check in these library changes, they are only needed for testing, and the Cordova build without these changes runs on a M1 processor (or later) Mac.

, but if that doesn't work you will
need to talk to Dale and get a password for apple@wevote.us, and then add it to your 
Xcodes's "Preferences" -> "Accounts" page

### Add your computer ot the iOS Team Provisioning Profile

If you get an error like:`Provisioning profile "iOS Team Provisioning Profile: org.wevote.cordova" doesn't include the currently selected device "Steve's MBP M1 Dec2021" (identifier 00006001-001451D92102801E).`

I had to go to `Signing and Capabilities` and add my latest Mac's name.

### At this point there are problems compiling the Google notifications code.  Calls to the code are disabled if isIOSAppOnMac(), but the binary libraries need to be removed if compiling on Apple Silicon at this time.

In package.json, remove the following lines (**DON"T CHECK IN THESE CHANGES**):

From "devDependencies":
  ```
  "cordova-plugin-firebase-analytics": "^6.1.0",
  "cordova-plugin-firebase-messaging": "^6.1.0",
  ```
From "dependencies":
  ```
  "cordova-support-google-services": "^1.4.1",
  ```
From "cordova": {  "plugins": 
  ```
  "cordova-plugin-firebase-messaging": {
    "ANDROID_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_VERSION": "21.0.0",
    "ANDROIDX_CORE_VERSION": "1.3.+",
    "IOS_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_VERSION": "~> 6.31.0",
    "IOS_FIREBASE_POD_VERSION": "~> 8.8.0"
  },
  "cordova-plugin-firebase-analytics": {
    "IOS_FIREBASE_POD_VERSION": "~> 8.8.0",
    "ANDROID_FIREBASE_CRASHLYTICS_VERSION": "19.0.+",
    "ANALYTICS_COLLECTION_ENABLED": "true",
    "AUTOMATIC_SCREEN_REPORTING_ENABLED": "true"
  },
  ```
### Run the App
![ScreenShot](docs/images/SuccessfulRunAppleSilicon.png)
And it should show up running in a container on the desktop (like a native app, which it kind of is)
![ScreenShot](docs/images/AppleSiliconRunning.png)


### Maybe you have to do this again (try running the app first) 
stevepodellsilicon@Steves-arm64-Mac WeVoteCordova % cordova platforms remove ios android
stevepodellsilicon@Steves-arm64-Mac WeVoteCordova % cordova platform add ios android

## Insufficient Storage warning on Android Simulator
![ScreenShot](docs/images/InstallFailedInsufficientStorage.png)
This happens too often, here are some steps that usually resolve it.
1) Close the "Emulator" window (hopefully, but not always ending the emulator session.)  This step is sometimes all it takes.
2) Open the device in the Device Manager, and "Change" the named device settings, "Edit the device", and make sure the Memory has not been reset to MB.  Set the memory to a very big number like "1 TB" (we don't have a native app, so this does not matter).  You will also probably have to reset the "Default Skin" to match the device if it says pull-down says "No Skin".
3) Delete any lock files in the emulator directory: `WeVoteCordova % rm  ~/.android/avd/Galaxy_Z_Fold_3_Samsung_API_33.avd/*lock`
4) Sometimes you have to exit out of Android Studio, and restart it.
5) Sometimes an old setup, or one that references an old skin, needs to be deleted and recreated.
